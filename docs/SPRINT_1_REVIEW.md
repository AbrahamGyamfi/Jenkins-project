### What Could Be Improved 🔧

1. **Frontend Testing Gap**
   - **Issue**: No React component tests yet
   - **Impact**: Frontend code coverage at 0%
   - **Improvement**: Add React Testing Library tests in Sprint 2

2. **Manual Deployment Process**
   - **Issue**: No automated deployment configured
   - **Impact**: Manual steps required to deploy
   - **Improvement**: Add deployment stage to CI/CD pipeline

3. **Limited Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Some edge cases may not have user-friendly error messages
   - **Impact**: User experience could be better in error scenarios
   - **Improvement**: Enhance error messaging and add error boundary

4. **No Persistent Storage**
